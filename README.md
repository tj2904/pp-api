# Positive Press - Python API Backend
![pp-api](https://github.com/tj2904/pp-api/assets/3164936/87d707c0-309e-4184-92f1-74390d9037f9)

A Python API that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically the Vader algorithm to analyse news headlines and provide a curated feed of news ranked by positivity. 
This is served by the backend app using FastAPI, and stored in a NoSQL database. The [documentation](https://positive-press-api.herokuapp.com/docs/) of the endpoints is provided using Swagger. 
There is also a consuming [frontend app](https://positive-press.vercel.app/) and [repo](https://www.github.com/tj2904/postive-press).
